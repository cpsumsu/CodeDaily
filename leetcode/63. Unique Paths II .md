> Problem : [63. Unique Paths II](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths-ii/)
# Method 1 : simple dp 
## reasoning  
- to find the possible paths that can reach the destination (existence of obstacles)
- a simple variant of previous path counting dp problems
- similar with the method 2 of [62. Unique Paths](62.%20Unique%20Paths.md)
- what differs is that, due to the existence of obstacles, we can not simply initialize the 0-th row and column by one and start from (1,1). 
- To be accurate, we still initialize the scrolling list with 1. However, within the loop we add few judging statements for boundary conditions,which is:
``` cpp
else if(i==0 && j==0) continue;
else if(i==0) dp[j] = dp[j-1];
else if(j==0) continue;
```
- For the detection of boundary conditions, we set the $dp[j]$ to $0$ when it comes across a obstacle. This line should be written before the boundary judgements and the dp correlation formula, or errors will occur.
```cpp
if(obstacleGrid[i][j]==1) dp[j] = 0;
```
## code 
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int uniquePathsWithObstacles(vector<vector<int>>& obstacleGrid) {
        int m = obstacleGrid.size();
        int n = obstacleGrid[0].size();
        vector<int>dp(n,1);
        for(int i=0; i<m; i++){
            for(int j=0; j<n; j++){
                if(obstacleGrid[i][j]==1) dp[j] = 0;
                else if(i==0 && j==0) continue;
                else if(i==0) dp[j] = dp[j-1];
                else if(j==0) continue;
                else dp[j] += dp[j-1];
            }
        }
        return dp[n-1];
    } 
};
```
