> Problem: [2840. Check if Strings Can be Made Equal With Operations II](https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-strings-can-be-made-equal-with-operations-ii/description/)

# Reasoning 
- we should think how to determine if the two string are "equal" instead of enumerating them with operations until they are equal
- there are two conditions: 
    - there exists identical number and type of alphabet between two strings 
    - the distance of same alphabet must be even (since swapped alphabet can't from odd index to even index, vice versa)
- However, we don't need to consider which alphabet correspond to another alphabet, that means if there are two 'a' in each string, first 'a' of first string matches first 'a' of second string, or mathes second 'a' of second string as well
- this leads to an interesting result, if two string are equal, they have to fulfill the following conditions:
    - ofz, there exists identical alphabet
    - the summation of same alphabet of two strings must be even (why?)
        - the distance between two same alphabet must be even
        - so if the index of an alphabet in first string is odd, then that of alphabet in second string must be odd
        - so if the index of an alphabet in first string is even, then that of alphabet in second string must be even
        - so summation of two add or two even must be even

# Code
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool checkStrings(string s1, string s2) {
        vector<int64_t> cnt(26, 0), alpha(26, 0);

        for (int i = 0; i < s1.size(); i++) {
            cnt[s1[i] - 'a']++;
            cnt[s2[i] - 'a']--;
            alpha[s1[i] - 'a'] += i;
            alpha[s2[i] - 'a'] += i;
        }      

        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) 
            if (cnt[i] || alpha[i] % 2)     // if cnt[i] != 0, then the alphabet between two strings are not the same
                return false;               // `alpha[i] % 2` checks whether the summation of index is even or not
        return true;
    }
};
