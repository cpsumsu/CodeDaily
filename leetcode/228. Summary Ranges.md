> Problem: [228. Summary Ranges](https://leetcode.com/problems/summary-ranges/description/)

## Analysis 
- we can do it in a very easy way like two for loop, 
- the hardest part is to consider about is the format of one character and many characters
- also be aware that the test case might be [..., 2^31 - 1, ...], that means nums[j] + 1 is overflow
- but it seem that the test case is small that does not encounter this situation

## Code 
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> summaryRanges(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        vector<string> ret;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int j = i;

            while (j + 1 < n && nums[j] + 1 == nums[j + 1])
                j++;

            if (j > i) {
                ret.push_back(to_string(nums[i]) + "->" + to_string(nums[j]));
            } else {
                ret.push_back(to_string(nums[i]));
            }

            i = j;
        }

        return ret;
    }
};
