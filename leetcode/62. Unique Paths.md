> Problem : [62. Unique Paths](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths/)
# solution 1
## analysis 
- the question asks for the possible unique paths, which is in order words, to find the largest number paths when it reaches the finish point. 
- unique paths is a classic dp question, so let's try to solve it using the dp approach right away.
- we define dp[y][x] be the largest number of unique paths at the grid[y][x]. 
- as there is only 2 ways to reach a grid, from the *left* or from the *top*. 
- which means the largest number of unique paths of a grid[y][x], would be the sum of the largest number of unique paths of grid[y-1][x](the top) and grid[y][x-1](the left).
- so the dp relation formula would be:
$ dp[j][i] = dp[j-1][i] + dp[j][i-1] $
- now deal with initialization and the loop statement, we can initialize the first column and row of the dp array with 1, as with only right and downward movement, there is only one possible path for the grids.
- so the loop statement would be i->n, j->m.
- and print out the result dp[m-1][n-1].

## code 
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {
        vector<vector<int>>dp(m,vector<int>(n,1));
    for(int i=1;i<n;i++){
        for(int j=1;j<m;j++){
            dp[j][i] = dp[j-1][i]+dp[j][i-1];
        }
    }
    return dp[m-1][n-1];
    }
};
```

## complexity
### Time
>$O(m*n)$
### Space
>$O(n*m)$

# solution 2
## analysis
- as the dp state is only related to j and j-1 rows. So we can optimize the solution by using the scrolling array technique to make the dp array using only 1 dimensional space
- the dp[j] before adding represents the original **i-1**-th row, and the dp[j-1] is the new, which is the **i**-th row after adding.
- this reduces the space complexity to $O(n)$.

## code
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {
    vector<int>dp(n,1);
    for(int i=1;i<m;i++){
        for(int j=1;j<n;j++){
            dp[j] += dp[j-1];
        }
    }
    return dp[n-1];
    }
};
```
## complexity
### Time
>$O(m*n)$
### Space
>$O(n)$
