> Problem : [120. Triangle](https://leetcode.com/problems/triangle/)
# Method 1 : dp 
## reasoning  
- can be seen as a variant of path problems with one destination, various starting points.
- the destination would be the head of the triangle
- the starting points would be the bases of the triangle
- **steps of solving:**
    - directly implement the scroll-list, initialize the dp array with the maximum size of triangle, with the elements of the bases. *(starting points)*
    ```cpp
    vector<int> dp (n,0);
    for(int i = 0; i<n;i++) dp[i] = triangle[n-1][i];
    ```
    - then we loop from the bottom i=n-1 -> i=0. 
    ```cpp
    for(int i = n-1; i>0; i--)
    ```
    - and the answer would be $dp[0]$. *(the definition of dp[i] here is the minimum sum of path at the element i in the scroll-list)*
## code 
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumTotal(vector<vector<int>>& triangle) {
        int n = triangle.size();
        vector<int> dp (n,0);
        for(int i = 0; i<n;i++) dp[i] = triangle[n-1][i];
        for(int i = n-1; i>0; i--){
            for(int j=0 ; j<i; j++){
                dp[j] = min(dp[j],dp[j+1])+ triangle[i-1][j];
            }
        }
        return dp[0];
    }
};
```
