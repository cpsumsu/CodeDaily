> Problem: [1561. Maximum Number of Coins You Can Get](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-coins-you-can-get/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2023-11-24)

# Reasoning
- In each round, find the two highest number of coins and one lowest number of coins
- sum up with the second highest number of coins in each round

## ie: piles = [9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4]
- first round, [9, 8, 1], ans += 8
- second round, [7, 6, 2], ans += 6
- third round, [5, 4, 3], ans += 4
- so result is 18

# Complexity
## Time Complexity
> $O(NlogN)$
## Space Complexity
> $O(1)$

# code
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxCoins(vector<int>& piles) {
        sort(piles.begin(), piles.end());

        int N = piles.size(), sum = 0;
        // piles[j] is the second highest number of coins in each round
        for (int i = 0, j = N - 2; i < j; i++, j -= 2) {
            sum += piles[j];
        }

        return sum;
    }
};
```

# Similar implementation

## Reasoning
- since there are 3n piles, and we want to get the second highest
- so only need to find (N / 3 - 1, N] interval of sorted vector piles

# Code
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxCoins(vector<int>& piles) {
        sort(piles.begin(), piles.end());

        int N = piles.size(), sum = 0;
        for (int i = N - 2; i > N / 3 - 1; i -= 2) {
            sum += piles[i];
        }

        return sum;
    }
};
```
