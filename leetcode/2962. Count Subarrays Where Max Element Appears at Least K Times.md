> Problem: [2962. Count Subarrays Where Max Element Appears at Least K Times](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-subarrays-where-max-element-appears-at-least-k-times/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-03-22)

# Idea
use slibing window to find the subsequence with at least k frequency. then use `start` as contribution value. When the subsequence decrease in size, the number increases `start` , therefore `ans += start`.

For example, [1, 3, 2, 3, 4, 3], k = 2:
[1, 3, 2, 3] => [3, 2, 3] , the starting point increase to second element. Then 
[3, 2, 3, 4], the number of such subsequence include [1, 3, 2, 3, 4], [3, 2, 3, 4]. That is, `ans += 2`, which start = 2


# Complexity
## Time Complexity

> $\mathcal{O}(N)$ 

`max_element()` contribute O(N). Outer for loop traverse N - 1 elements. inner while loop traverses at most N - k - 1 and variale `start` doesn't traverse back, therefore, the two loops traverse all element at most twice

## Space Complexity

> $\mathcal{O}(1)$

# Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long countSubarrays(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int m = *max_element(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        int64_t start = 0, ans = 0;

        for (int end = 0; end < nums.size(); end++) {
            if (nums[end] == m)
                k--;

            while (!k) {
                if (nums[start] == m)
                    k++;
                start++;
            }

            ans += start;
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
```
