> Problem: [1637. Widest Vertical Area Between Two Points Containing No Points](https://leetcode.com/problems/widest-vertical-area-between-two-points-containing-no-points/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2023-12-21)
# Reasoning 
- only compare the width (x-asix), since the y-asix is infinite

# Complexity
## Time Complexity
> $O(n)$
## Space Complexity
> $O(1)$

# Code
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxWidthOfVerticalArea(vector<vector<int>>& points) {
        sort(points.begin(), points.end());
        int max_wid = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < points.size() - 1; i++) {
            int x = abs(points[i][0] - points[i + 1][0]);
            max_wid = max(max_wid, x);
        }

        return max_wid;
    }
};
```
