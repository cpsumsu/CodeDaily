> Problem: [2958. Length of Longest Subarray With at Most K Frequency](https://leetcode.com/problems/length-of-longest-subarray-with-at-most-k-frequency/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-03-28)

# 思路
We need to find to the **subarray**. 

- Use sliding window. we initialize a starting point and ending point, and then move the ending point.
- Record the len by using (end - start + 1)
- If we find the frequency of this element is execeed k, then move this element from the starting point, using a while loop

# Example
consider [1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2], k = 2
- until [1, 2, 3, 1], the frequency in the subarray is still fine.
- However, if we try to include next element, [1, 2, 3, 1, 1] then we have three 1. 
- We need to remove the starting element, but we don't know whether this element can reduce the frequency of 1, use while loop until the frequency fulfill the requirement
- then we have [2, 3, 1, 1], keep going [2, 3, 1, 1, 2]
- so the final result is 5

# 复杂度

时间复杂度:
> $\mathcal{O}(n)$

空间复杂度:
> $\mathcal{O}(n\ logn)$

# Code
```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxSubarrayLength(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        unordered_map<int, int> m;
        int ans = 0;
        
        for (int start = 0, end = 0; end < nums.size(); end++) {
          m[nums[end]]++;

          while (m[nums[end]] > k) {
            m[nums[start++]]--;
          }

          ans = max(ans, end - start + 1);
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
```
  
# second method
remove the nested loop

# idea
- we know that we insert a new element in each iteration. If the frequency is exceed, then we remove that element. 
- But in fact, we don't need to know which element exceed. What we need to know is that if the element exceed, we need to find a new starting point.
- use `overk` to let the algorithm knows there are exceed elements in the array, so it start to increase starting point to try to remove those elements at the same time.
- It is guarantee that all the exceed element can be removed since the removing process start simultanously.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxSubarrayLength(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        unordered_map<int, int> m;
        int overk = 0, start = 0;

        for (int end = 0; end < nums.size(); end++) {
          m[nums[end]]++;

          if (m[nums[end]] == k + 1) {
            overk++;
          }

          if (overk > 0) {
            m[nums[start]]--;
            if (m[nums[start]] == k)
              overk--;
            start++;
          }
        }

        return nums.size() - start;
    }
};
```
