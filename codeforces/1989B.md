title: "1989B - Substring and Subsequence"
tags: ["string", "greedy"]

# Reasoning 
- our target is to minimize the `ans`
- since string B requries subsequence instead of substring, to iterate B to find substring A is much easier than iterate A to find subsequence B
- the first loop is to iterate B, the second one iterate A and substring B to minimize `ans`
- if `j - i` > 0, that means we cannot find the whole string A in B. So, concatenate the remaining characters of A into B

# example
A = aba, B = cba

we find that only "ba" is matched. therefore, concat the remaining character `a` from A to B. so the result is `cbaa`. ans = 4


# Code
```cpp
// https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1989/B
#include <iostream>

void run_case() {
    string A, B;
    cin >> A >> B;

    int n = A.size(), m = B.size(), ans = n + m;

    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        int j = i;

        for (auto a : A)
            if (j < m && a == B[j])
                j++;

        ans = min(ans, n + m - (j - i));
    } 

    cout << ans << '\n';
}

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(0);
    
    int tests;
    cin >> tests;
    while (tests-- > 0)
        run_case();
    
    return 0;
}
```
