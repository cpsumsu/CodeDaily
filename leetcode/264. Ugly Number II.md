> Problem: [264. Ugly Number II](https://leetcode.com/problems/ugly-number-ii/description/)

## Analysis 
- see hints in leetcode
- a new ugly number must be the multiple of old ugly number
- the question becomes list all the combination of 2, 3, 5 (since they are ugly number as well) in ascending order
- in this case, `t2, t3, t5` are use as `pointer`
- in each time, a[i] must maintain the minimum value of combination of 2, 3, 5

## Complexity
### Time
> $O(n)$
### Space
> $O(n)$

n in range[1, 1690] in this question

## Code 
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int nthUglyNumber(int n) {
        vector<int> a(n);

        a[0] = 1;
        int t2 = 0, t3 = 0, t5 = 0;

        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            int A = a[t2] * 2;
            int B = a[t3] * 3;
            int C = a[t5] * 5;

            a[i] = min({A, B, C});

            if (a[i] == A) t2++;
            if (a[i] == B) t3++;
            if (a[i] == C) t5++;
        }

        return a[n - 1];
    }
};
```
