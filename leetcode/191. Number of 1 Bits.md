> Problem: [191. Number of 1 Bits](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-1-bits/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2023-11-29)

# Reasoning 
- small trick to deal with bit manipulation, `n & (n - 1)` to remove the right significant bit
- ie: 10 (decimal) == 1010 (binary), `n & (n - 1)` => 1010 & 1001 => 1000. so 0010 is removed
- then count how many bit can be removed

# Complexity
## Time Complexity
> $O(logN)$
## Space Complexity
> $O(1)$

# Code
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int hammingWeight(uint32_t n) {
        int cnt = 0;

        while (n) {
            cnt++;
            n = (n & (n - 1));
        }

        return cnt;
    }
};
```

# use built in function in c++!!!

# code 
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int hammingWeight(uint32_t n) {
        return __builtin_popcount(n);
    }
};
```
